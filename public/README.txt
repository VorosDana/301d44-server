Time Estimates:

CDN libraries
Estimated: 20m
Actual: 45m
Had a lot of trouble finding cdn entries, then I discovered that most of these were built by the source of the frameworks.

Header video
Estimated: 2h
Actual: 1h
I finally gave up, made the video 100% high and gave it a negative z index. It works.

Deploy to Heroku
Was already done

Remove Tablet Hamburger
Estimated: 45m
Actual: 30m
I just sliced out css that made the menu function, including formatting for various components

Other personalization
TODO: add more project in portfolio, make git links more apparent

I had a lot of trouble getting everything to work properly. Icons are still misaligned, I can't find the difference between mine and the source causing it
